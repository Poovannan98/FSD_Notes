### Spread operator **`...`**

1. concat/Merge arrays
2. Cancat/Merge objects
3. Copy arrays and objects
4. Override keys in objects
5. Spread used in any position in the array
6. To pass array as seprate aruguments

### Rest operator **`...`**

1. Destructing - collecting rest of the values
2. Rest element must be last element

### Object Short-hand

1. Key name & value name must be same

### **`this`** keyword

1. "this" requires context (book)
2. "this" is a reference word
3. until the function is called `this` does not point to anything
4. manually providing (explicit) context
   1. call - passing aruguments by comma separated
   2. apply - passing aruguments as an array
   3. bind - always returns a new function

### Arrow vs Normal Function

1. Arrow function - `this` does not point anything
2. hence we do not use `this` in arrow function
3. Shoter syntax

### OOP - Object Oriented Programming

Style of programming - Paradigm

1. OOP - JAVA
2. Fucntioal - F#, haskell, Scala
3. Procedural
4. Logical

JAVA class != JS class

JS Class implementation is done using functions

1. Class is the blueprint, which creates different objects (model)
2. class name starts with Capital letter
3. new creates an object
4. new calls the constructor
5. new makes `this` point the object

### `19-08-2022` Notes

member function

1. Avoiding wrong updates to member variables
2. Help in formatting results
3. All oblects share the member function
